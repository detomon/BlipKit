BlipKit
=======

[![Build Status](https://github.com/detomon/BlipKit/actions/workflows/c.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/detomon/BlipKit/actions/workflows/c.yml)

BlipKit is a C library for creating the beautiful sound of old sound chips.

- Generate waveforms: square, triangle, noise, sawtooth, sine and custom waveforms
- Use an unlimited number of individual tracks
- Use stereo output or up to 8 channels
- Define instruments to create envelopes and other interesting effects
- Use effects: portamento, tremolo, vibrato and some more
- Load multi-channel samples and play them at different pitches

Basic Example
-------------

This code demonstrates the basic steps to generate audio data of a square wave in the note A with enabled tremolo effect:

```c
// The context object contains the audio buffers.
BKContext ctx;

// The track object generates the waveform.
BKTrack track;

// Initialize context with 2 channels (stereo).
// and a sample rate of 44100 Hz.
BKContextInit(&ctx, 2, 44100);

// Initialize track with square wave.
// By default, the square wave has a duty cycle of 4 (12.5%).
BKTrackInit(&track, BK_SQUARE);

// Set mix and note volume.
BKSetAttr(&track, BK_MASTER_VOLUME, 0.15 * BK_MAX_VOLUME);
BKSetAttr(&track, BK_VOLUME, 1.0 * BK_MAX_VOLUME);

// Set note A in octave 3.
BKSetAttr(&track, BK_NOTE, BK_A_3 * BK_FINT20_UNIT);

// Enable tremolo effect.
BKInt tremolo[2] = { 20, 0.66 * BK_MAX_VOLUME };
BKTrackSetEffect(&track, BK_EFFECT_TREMOLO, tremolo, sizeof(tremolo));

// Attach track to context.
BKTrackAttach(&track, &ctx);

// Define buffer to write audio data to.
// As there are 2 channels used, the buffer must be
// twice the size than number of frames are requested.
BKFrame frames[512 * 2];

// Generate 512 frames, e.g., as they would be requested by an audio output function (SDL).
// Subsequent calls to this function generate the next requested number of frames.
BKContextGenerate(&ctx, frames, 512);

// The channels are interlaced into the buffer in the form: LRLR...
// Which means that the first frame of the left channel is at frames[0],
// the first frame of the right channel at frames[1] and so on...
```

Building the Library
--------------------

First execute `autogen.sh` in the base directory to generate the build system:

```sh
sh ./autogen.sh
```

Next execute `configure` in the base directory:

```sh
./configure
```

Use the `--without-sdl` option if you don't want to link against SDL.

```sh
./configure --without-sdl
```

Then execute `make` to build `libblipkit.a` in the `src` directory:

```sh
make
```

Optionally, you may want to execute to install the library and headers on your system:

```sh
sudo make install
```

Building and Running Examples
-----------------------------

All examples use SDL (<http://www.libsdl.org>) to output sound, so you have to install it first. Execute `make examplename` to build an example in the `examples` directory.

```sh
# in `examples`

make tone
make divider
make stereo
make scratch
make waveform
make envelope
```

Finally, run examples like this:

```sh
# in `examples`

./tone
```
